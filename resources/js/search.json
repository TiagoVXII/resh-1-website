[[{"i":"what-is-the-resh-1-","l":"What is the Resh-1 ?","p":["MTF Rēsh-1, given the nickname \"Seat of Consciousness\", is an elite classified task force taking orders directly from The Administrator. Rēsh-1 commonly works with MTF Alpha-1 and MTF Omega-1. Some custom canons mention that all Rēsh-1 operators have Omni/L5 clearance, however, this information cannot be confirmed in any way. MTF Rēsh-1 only responds when the Foundation fails to execute standard protocols, or when the O5 Council fails to complete a task given by The Administrator. MTF Rēsh-1 is most likely, made out of the best Foundation operatives in the world. They were able to execute [Redacted] missions to kill the [Redacted] on several occasions. One of these occasions were incident-1-001-alpha, DETAILS this started when the foundation discovered [Redacted] the foundation figured out that he was a vessel for [Redacted] and in further experiments this made him not able to recognize the [Redacted], In return they were not able to be [Redacted] or [Redacted], the ethics committee later found out and sent Mobile Task Force Omega-1 “Law's Left Hand”. In return the Administrator realised and sent his Mobile Task Force “Rēsh-1” to intervene. /SITE 01 CAMERA FEED\\ shows: all three MTFs having a massive battle throughout SITE 01 Shows: multiple men and women on the ground alive after being shot in the head.
